### Inspiration
For refugees, settling in a new country can be a challenging and overwhelming experience, especially if they are unfamiliar with the language, culture, and resources available to them. LightHouse is created to help address these challenges by providing refugees with information and resources that can help them navigate their new surroundings more easily. The inspiration behind Lighthouse have come from a refugee team members and the desire to help refugees integrate into their new communities, connect with resources that can support them, and ultimately build new lives for themselves and their families in the United States.
